<p>The portion of Allegheny County lying between the Monongahela   
and Youghiogheny Rivers, and known for many years in the early  
times as the "Forks of Yough", was particularly rich in such finds  
[i.e., Native American artifacts], and must have been largely  
populated  at some  early  period of its existence. Half a dozen or  
more farms of the region had remains of fortified villages on their  
hilltops, each such location  being known to the land owner and his  
family as "the  old  fort  field". These were plainly marked when the  
land began to be cultivated and long afterwards, but now are rapidly  
passing, if they have not gone entirely.
        The farms in many cases have passed into other hands in the later   
years, but in the following  list the pioneer names are  given:   
In  Forward Township, the Wall and Guffey places; in Elizabeth   
Township, the Warren, Wilson, McKinley, McKnight and Douglass places;  
in Lincoln Township, the Edmundson place. All of these exhibited  
similar characteristics, with earthen walls or embankments,  more or  
less plainly marked, and a profusion of shells, pottery fragments,  
  stone  hatchets, arrow-heads, beads  and other objects. Human bones  
also were found in the vicinities of these works from time to time.  In  
the vicinity of Large, in Jefferson Township, there were similar  
finds.

        When Allegheny County  was set up in 1788,  all of its portion  
between the rivers was named Elizabeth Township, for the town on the  
Monongahela [i.e., Elizabeth] which had been established the year  
before. The borough was cut off from the old township when it was  
incorporated in 1834, but the remainder continued in the one great  
township. It was  not until 1869 that it was divided into three parts,  
the southernmost receiving the name Forward, the northern tip being   
called Lincoln and the remainder, in the  middle, retaining  the  
name of Elizabeth Township. Lincoln Township has been much reduced   
in size  in the years  succeeding, as portions have been taken in the  
making of the boroughs  of Glassport, Port Vue, Liberty and  
Reynoldton, the one last named being now part of the City of  
McKeesport. Elizabeth  and Forward  Township territory has been  
reduced  slightly by additions to the Borough of Elizabeth.
